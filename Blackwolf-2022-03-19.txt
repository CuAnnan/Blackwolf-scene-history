	As always, at the Trod to the Shadow Court Chamber there is an agent with a set of robes and a plane white mask for each Courtier. The Robes are enchanted with Cantrips to hide your identity and the Mask will either take the form of your choice or remain plain and white. When you step through the Trod into the Council Chamber, you can see that roughly half of the people present have elected to leave the masks as is where the others have opted for animals, monsters, one Dali style face and one kabuki mask.

	As those who have been here before also know, the shape and form of the room also conforms to the mood and tone of the day; today it appears like a newspaper bullpen, the fence around the enclosed circle at the centre where you all gather comprises of oversized wooden pillars beyond which printing machines soundlessly press out today's edition.

	At the center, on the editor in chief's desk, there is a map of the west coast of the Continental US with grey pins, black pins and white pins. Blackwolf, the Commoner Satyr largely in charge of the Western Coast and only Courtier not in a robe and mask, is wearing a tweed suit jacket. He mutters with the member of one of the other chapters and dismisses them with a gesture, when the last of the cell wander off, a small circle on the ground glows in feint blue and he gestures in the LA cell. The map zooms in and shows the state of Los Angeles, the Point Vicente Freehold shows in Grey while Santa Catalina island is colored black. Boats can be seen in the water flying the flags of the Menehune and Mer Houses.

	"Your report is no doubt complicated this month by the transportation of Caer Angeles into the Deep Shadow," Blackwolf says, "Our Thallain Cousins were tinkering with magic they only half understand and had only half of the ingredients for," he shakes his head with the frustration that the lost opportunity represents, "I urged them to wait for one of our agents to acquire one of the two other artefacts but they would not countenance waiting and now, instead of having a tool of near infinite power, we have a crater. It cannot be helped and none of you are being held responsible. It is the folly of their kind."

Arkady leaves his mask plain, prefering to blend in with the crowd rather than make any kind of personal statement. He leaves his top hat, opening down, outside with the attendants. Then, as his kind are so good at doing, he remains as silent as possible while watching and listening to the going ons.
──────────────────────────
───<Leith>───────────────
There's an exhale from Leith, behind his mask. "Despite what progress I was able to make," he notes, "none of it involved the locations of the artifacts. Obviously. And the more I insert myself into the goings-on of the County, of course, the greater the possibility that I'm painting a target on my own back though the sheer fact of my own inquisitiveness." He laces his fingers together. "I'm not opposed to this; I long ago determined that my own life is a relatively small price to pay, in the larger cause. But if there's something strategic I can offer in return which won't compromise the mission's overall success, it may help to at least assuage suspicion for the time being, or lay it elsewhere."
─────────────────────────
───<Blackwolf>───────────────
	Blackwolf shakes his head at Leith. "You are one of the few competent agents we have in the area. There are others in the region that you can leverage, I think at this stage we may have to reconsile ourselves to abandoning that project. We don't even know *what* the artefacts are; there was some theorising that they may have been fragments of the original Excalibur, or perhaps even shards of one of or more of the four Tuathan Treasures. Our seers are not able to pull together the correct workign to simultaneously scry them and avoid detection by the Moirae, the Morphean Oracles or the Crystal Circle." He lets out a low sigh of his own as he paces, his hooves clacking against the obsidian floor, before continuing. "And our supposed allies in the black council," there is a degree of scorn here that he has only displayed while talking about the Noble Houses, "are not being forthcoming. At least they didn't get more than one, heavens know what their incompetence would have done with two or even all three of the artefacts."
	"None the less," he says still addressing Leith, "your best off serving us in the continued shadows. That intel you got us during the last fracas with the agents of the black council allowed us to feed the information back to the Houses Fiona and Gwydion and thus put them in our debt. We intend on using that debt during the next Parliamentary vote. We will need to ensure that the Concordian House votes a certain way too, but getting our hooks in there has proven more difficult than we had anticipated since its reformation."

<OOC> Arkady says, "Going to just be a lot of listening and watching type poses from Arkady, so feel free to speed ahead without waiting for me."
<OOC> Blackwolf :thumbs up: "Honestly, your attendance alone stands you in good stead."
───<Leith>───────────────
Leith nods to Blackwolf. "I'm - disappointed to hear that," he admits, regarding abandonment of the project. "There's one fate-teller I know of who might be swayed but she's sworn herself to the Fiona baron as his court seer, and I doubt it'd be feasible to convince even one of those strange beings to break an oath like that. I've at least gained a bit of trust from some of the Count's closest, although I may have pushed it a bit far with the Count himself. It's hard to say. Nothing a little groveling won't fix, anyway, and I'm not above swallowing my pride if it means advancing our movement." 

His head tilts to the side, back and forth, as he considers. "Perhaps I can be of use in the political sphere as well. As you see, information and persuasion are more my style than fisticuffs. If I know what the vote is meant to be, and who is most likely to be swayed, I can work on it. I have little stock in my own title other than the continued knowledge and remembrance that when the Sidhe returned from Arcadia, they took the freeholds that had long been cared for by commoner kith without a second thought, but among the other nobles it may gain me some leeway."
─────────────────────────
───<Blackwolf>───────────────
	Blackwolf nods his head "The legislation is innocuous enough, a land deed issue ammending the rights of commoners. It's been in the works for some time now but the halls of powers turn slowly and almost always in a way which serves the purposes of the Noble Houses alone. The legislative power of the Concordian House is a mere token but this should go some way to better dissolve the power of the Nobles in ten or so years. Though it is difficult circumventing the Arcadian Sidhe Frailty, we will evententually strip them of the benefit that the Dreaming confers upon Nobles." The words, which spoken literally anywhere else might get one killed, have been the basic aim of the Shadow Court since shortly after the Accordance War.
─────────────────────────────
───<Leith>───────────────
From behind his mask, there's a bright gleam in Leith's dark eyes as he nods along with Blackwolf's words. "There are ways to circumvent it, certainly," he agrees. "Particularly by leveraging one's own relationships with Sidhe who are susceptible to persuasion and eloquence. Ten years is nothing in the grand scheme of things. This is encouraging news to me, and I'm happy to throw my efforts behind it."

───<Arkady>───────────────
The sluagh stands amongst the other assembled robe wearing members, quietly watching and listening. Politics are not his cup of tea, which is a weird thing for someone who has dedicated themselves to a revolutionary cabal. All the same though, he tries to pay attention, knowing all information has value.
──────────────────────────
───<Blackwolf>───────────────
	Blackwolf nods "I was hoping to hear from the Balor Baron, he has not done anything for the cause, he is however under your authority ostensibly. However, his absence from these halls and, as best as we can tell, the arena at large in Los Angeles is not ... encouraging. I think we may need to proactively test his loyalty but I have not given any consideration to how. Can I leave that in your hands?"
─────────────────────────────
───<Leith>───────────────
"In my hands?" Leith huffs a breath softly. "I've never even met him, but I suppose in speaking to those who do know him I'll be able to come up with something, comrade. Given what I said to you about his loyalty already being under suspicion from the Scathatch Baroness, it may be to our benefit to ensure we're not carrying any dead weight, so to speak."
─────────────────────────
───<Blackwolf>───────────────
	A slow, somewhat sinister, grin croses Blackwolf's features and he nods. "I see I *can* leave his in your hands. Leverage him however you see fit. If there is nothing else to report from Los Angeles, I will allow you get back to it. We all have plans in motion and I would not keep them from you longer than is needed."
─────────────────────────────
───<Leith>───────────────
Another nod from Leith, whose eyes still continue to gleam brightly behind his mask. "I have nothing new for you beyond my last report from the skirmish in the Far Dreaming," he acknowledges. "Still no news from either of the Thallain you asked me to see about, though I offered them shelter and aid if needed; I fear they were already rooted out by Ser Trevor. Anything else and you will hear from me promptly, Comrade. I wish you success in your endeavors, for the equality of all."
